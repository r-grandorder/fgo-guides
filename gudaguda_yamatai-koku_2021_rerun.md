## __**3. Frequently Asked Questions/How-To**__

- Do not try to rush the event, there are timegates a day for the first week and the best nodes usually only go up when the epilogue gets released.
- Raids start on 7-Nov (Sun) 18:00 JST. Be prepared by keeping up with the event and having your damage CEs bought out from the event shop. You will need a drop from any event FQ/Raid to MLB it. 
-- Rerun changes: The shop now has 5 CEs in the shop, no need for a drop from the FQ/Raid.
- ★ 1 (C) Oda Nobukatsu :nobukatsuder: :Archer: is a limited servant available from Friend Point summoning who will go away after the event is over. Ensure that you get him ASAP. He is also a useful low-cost event bonus servant that you should be bringing to all Free Quests to maximize resource drops. 
<https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Oda_Nobukatsu>
-- Rerun changes: You get 15 servant coins from rolling Nobukatsu in the FP banner.
- While doing Free Quests, bring along the proper Event Bonus Servants to boost resource drops which are required to do Restoration Quests and for advancing the story. 
- Complete Restoration Quests to unlock/upgrade your fields. The sooner you get them done, the more rewards you will be able to collect as they run on 8-12 hour timers. 
- When a field is upgraded, the timer on it is reset and started. This does not count as a turn-in and will not yield rewards. Therefore, best practice is to collect the reward as soon as you unlock the field, then upgrade it to max immediately following so that the next time you are able to turn in, it will be for the maxed out rewards. 
- It may be ideal to farm resources preemptively so as to be prepared for unlocking fields / upgrading them as soon as they become available. You will need some of each resource for every field to unlock/fully upgrade them. Plan accordingly.
- You must participate at least once in the Raid Battle phase of the event to be eligible for the rewards from Missions 24-30. If you were not caught up with the event, it is likely that you will miss the Gold Fous from Missions 27 & 29. 
-- Rerun changes: There's no longer a need to have participated in the raids to get the mission rewards. Doing the 5AP quests should allow you to clear the missions.
- The on/off button at the Event's map is for notifications when your farm's timer is up.

## __**4. GUDAGUDA Event Raid Info (Starts on 7-Nov)**__

* Saber - Inflicts Burn on your team for 3 Turns
* Archer - Guts (10k HP) 
* Lancer - Random Chance Invincibility for 2 Hits (rec. 2016 Summer MC)
* Rider - 50% NP Drain at start of battle
* Caster - Buff Block for 3 Turns (rec. Atlas MC)
* Assassin - Inflicts Curse on your team for 3 Turns
* Berserker - Random Chance Evade for 3 Turns (rec. 2016 Summer MC)

- Raid bosses can drop the shop CE if you have not MLB’d it already. 
- Put up Chaldea Teatime / Bella Lisa on your Event Support Lists. :MashuNo: :davincerlily:
- These raids are not great if you are looking for material drops as they are level 80 nodes at best. Only refill farm these if you are looking for speedy clears. Otherwise, you are better off clearing standard Free Quests. 

* There's been reports of people experiencing some sort of lag or the animations gets stuck. Don't tap on the big nobu during loading and wait for the game to fully load your servants and their skills before doing anything. DW has acknowledged the bug: <https://twitter.com/fgoproject/status/1457296546009997314>

## __**5. Challenge Quest**__

- :maouder: :Avenger: (478k/527k/600k) / :nobukatsuhorror: :Archer: (407k/420k)
- Maou Nobunaga begins the battle with a permanent Defense Buff.
- Nobukatsu plays the support role, cycling through various buffs that he gives his sister while he is alive. He starts the battle with NP Seal on himself.
- Breaking Nobukatsu's bar will cause him to clear his debuffs and NP instantly (kills him and buffs Maou). 
- If you manage to kill Maou first, Nobukatsu will be buffed significantly, though this is more difficult and not recommended.

## __**7. Free Quest Info**__

<https://twitter.com/niconikon01/status/1457401687358935043>

- Note that there are two sets of event drops; shop currency and resources which are used for Restoration Quests. Bonuses are on gacha CEs and servants (class-based) respectively. 
- __Final things to do after the epilogue (Released on 10-Nov 1800 JST)__ - there are a couple of restoration / story quests that you need to do before the Challenge Quest will unlock. It may require you to farm for more resources, though if you have an excess stock of any particular one from raiding, you can use the event shop to exchange for what you need. These last few quests will reward an additional ATK/HP Fou as well as various ascension materials.
