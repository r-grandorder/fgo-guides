# Fate/Requiem Board Game Apocalypse

# Mosaic City Monopoly (Game #1)

* Clear Free Quests and get <Dice> as drops
* Roll <Dice> to move in the board. There are different types of <Dice>
    * White - Move 1-6 spaces
    * Red - Move 1-3 spaces
    * Blue - Move 4-6 spaces
    * Gold - Move a specific (1, 2 or 3) number of spaces
* With the dice rolls, there's some randomness on the order of encounters you will get. You could save the Red, Blue and Gold <Dice> for later rolls when there's only a few spaces that is left to unlock.
* The event's first board runs like a simple version of the monopoly board game, you move your token around by rolling the dice and interacting with quests on the spaces you land on.
* When you land on 6 or 16, you go to "jail" at 11.
* The "Go" space will always make you stop on that space when you've rolled any number that may go beyond it.
    * This only happens for the first few rounds, when there are still unlockable tokens in "Go". When you're done with the quests on the "Go" space, it will allow you to move the number of spaces you've rolled.
* Upon landing on a space, you will unlock a Quest. Do those quests (check node in the middle of the board to check if you have new quests). Finishing the Quest may give a <Gappoly Token>
    * There are markers on the board on how many quests and <Gappoly Token> are left for you to unlock. This is where the Gold <Dice> will come in handy later on. See [Markers](#markers) below.
    * For spaces with two tokens (that aren't "Go" and "Jail"), you'll only get to unlock the 2nd token when you land on that space for the 5th time, there are 3 small blue dots underneath the tokens indicating how many runs left.
    * **(Update 30-May)** Did some tests (was finally able to clear some spaces), and it looks like this isn't correct. The game doesn't reroll for you, the dice still gets used up.
    * **(Update 28-May)** Since the colored <Dice> are farmable from the free quests and the board allowing you to reroll when landing on a cleared space, there's not much point in saving them for later. If your goal is to fully clear the board, you can just use the dice as you wish. You could save some gold <Dive> to directly jump to a space with an obtainable <Gappoly Token> for cases where you lack some tokens to unlock the other games.
* When you run out of dice, do Free Quests then rinse and repeat
* When you collect 4 tokens, you will unlock the 2nd board game <Werewolf Haunted House>.

# Werewolf (Game #2)

# Game #3

* Requires 15 <Gappoly Token>
* Plays like Board #2, straightforward fights.

# Game #4

* Requires 20 <Gappoly Token>
* Forced Supports, and you need to fight a 1v1 duel. The story changes depending on whether you win or lose a duel.
* Win condition: Win 3x in a row or Win a total of 5 games
* Game Over: Lose 3x in a row or Lose a total of 5 games. You get to retry the game until you win it.
* Check the appmedia page for details of the fights: [https://appmedia.jp/fategrandorder/4869568](https://appmedia.jp/fategrandorder/4869568) (scroll down a bit til you reach the 4th section)
* Check the support servant's skills and also choose your MC wisely. They've designed this to be winnable but you'll have to use the skills properly (e.g. using invul pierce skills against Jason). MCs that gives you an extra turn (evade, invul, guts) will help you a lot. There's also some tips on specific fights on the appmedia link above.
* If you want to have a go at unlocking all of the scenes or playing all the rounds, try these sequences (win:x, lose :-):

        xx-x-x---
        --x-x-xxx

# Game #5

* Requires 30 <Gappoly Token>
* A series of fights. Winning or losing (retreating also counts as a loss) will progress the story. If you lose, you don't get the drops from the fights (monuments). Fights details in: [https://appmedia.jp/fategrandorder/4869568](https://appmedia.jp/fategrandorder/4869568) (scroll to `第5のゲーム`)
* You will unlock Erice in this game towards the end.
* Erice is required to be in your front line in the Ghost Avenger fight.

# Final Game

* Not sure if it requires a certain number of token to continue, but it's just another set of straightforward fights.

# Bonus Quests

* Red Quests in the central node. Unlocks the Command Codes and Erice NP copies.
* [Appmedia has details on the fights](https://appmedia.jp/fategrandorder/4861522) (look for the `ボーナスクエストまとめ` section, use Google Translate to get the requirements in your preferred language)
* **(30 May Update)** There's a 16th bonus quest that only unlocks when the 1st game is fully completed (all diamond markers cleared) and all the 15 other bonus quests are done. This is likely the quest that is blocking the CQ from activating.

# Welfare Servant (Erice)

* No details yet on how to unlock her, she's probably behind the next time gate. Will update this post as we get more details.
* **(29-May Update)** Unlockable after finishing the main quests.
* **(31 May Update)** You will be able to NP5 erice once you complete all the tokens and some might be fine with that, but if you want to do the 16th bonus quest (10m QP, 5* exp), do the CQ and get the additional lore, you will have to clear the whole board.
