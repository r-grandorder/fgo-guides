# Chocolates
- Progressing the ladder will give you two types of Chocolate, &lt;Lock-on Chocolate&gt; and &lt;Surprise Chocolate&gt;
- &lt;Lock-On Chocolate&gt; will allow you to choose the servant's valentine scene to unlock
- &lt;Surprise Chocolate&gt; will randomly get you a scene.
- Any left over chocolates can be traded to QP after the event ends.
- There's a separate section for Getting Chocolates and Giving Chocolates
    - Note that some servants can both give and get chocolates from you.
![Choco](https://news.fate-go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2022/valentine2022_full_mxzlw/info_image_01.png)

- Servants with "Bad End" scenarios: Kingprotea, Astarte, Summer Kiara, Oberon, Koyanskaya of Light (her scenario needs you to encounter the "bad end" route to get the chocolate)
    - Choosing the wrong choices will not give you the chocolate CE, but it also won't consume the <Lock-on Chocolate> or <Surprise Chocolate> you have used. You can retry multiple times until you get the CE.
- You can use multiple &lt;Surprise Chocolate&gt; now and also skip scenes that you've previously seen.
    - Ticking the checkbox will skip the scenes.
