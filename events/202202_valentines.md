# Buddy Points
- For every quest you do, you earn &lt;Buddy Points&gt; per servant, you can think of it like it's Bond Points.
- The positioning of the Unit affects the amount of &lt;Buddy Points&gt; they get.
  
! Important Note !
{: .label .label-red }

- Support servants eat up the slot and the bonuses doesn't adjust. For example, if you have your friend support on the 1st (left most) slot, you're wasting the Best slot for buddy points.
  - It is recommended to put the supports on the 3rd slot or even better, the 6th (right most) slot and just plug them in if you're aiming to do 3t parties.
![Buddy Points](https://news.fate-go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2022/valentine2022_full_mxzlw/info_image_05.png)
- Getting the &lt;Buddy Points&gt; to a certain value will increase the Attack and Bond bonus of your servants.

# Chocolates
- Progressing the ladder will give you two types of Chocolate, &lt;Lock-on Chocolate&gt; and &lt;Surprise Chocolate&gt;
- &lt;Lock-On Chocolate&gt; will allow you to choose the servant's valentine scene to unlock
- &lt;Surprise Chocolate&gt; will randomly get you a scene.
- Any left over chocolates can be traded to QP after the event ends.
- There's a separate section for Getting Chocolates and Giving Chocolates
    - Note that some servants can both give and get chocolates from you.
![Choco](https://news.fate-go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2022/valentine2022_full_mxzlw/info_image_01.png)

- Servants with "Bad End" scenarios: Kingprotea, Astarte, Summer Kiara, Oberon, Koyanskaya of Light (her scenario needs you to encounter the "bad end" route to get the chocolate)
    - Choosing the wrong choices will not give you the chocolate CE, but it also won't consume the <Lock-on Chocolate> or <Surprise Chocolate> you have used. You can retry multiple times until you get the CE.

! Important Note !
{: .label .label-red }

- As a new QOL for this event, you can use multiple &lt;Surprise Chocolate&gt; now and also skip scenes that you've previously seen.
    - Ticking the checkbox will skip the scenes.
![Skip](https://news.fate-go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2022/valentine2022_full_mxzlw/info_image_03.png)

! Important Note !
{: .label .label-red }

- "★5 (SSR) Oberon"'s Valentine Scene is story locked, and requires clearing LB6 - Avalon Le Fae

# Hoshimi Teapots
- The Teapots we got recently are due to expire at the end of the month (February 28, 12:59 JST). It might be wise to use the teapots during this event.
- The Tea Break Quests (5AP that rewards Teapots) also give significant amount of Bond Points. You can use your teapots in there.

! Important Note !
{: .label .label-red }

- Make sure you have your servants at EX rank (See &lt;Buddy Points&gt; Section) to maximize the bond you get!
