# Costumes
- [Click here for the preview](https://news.fate-go.jp/2022/whiteday2022_glassesdress/){:target="_blank"}
- The tickets to unlock (like the Waltz event, no need to spend QP/materials during the event period) the costumes are obtainable from Main Quests. Progress the story to get all 13 costumes.
- You can still obtain the costume even if you don't own the servant, but you won't be able to use the tickets as they expire some time after the event.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why can't I buy the costumes?
- The costumes are story locked, we'll likely get them one by one as we progress the story. Like how the Waltz event handled the costumes.

### Which CE should I buy?
- Firstly, pick who you like.
- If you want to go for a gameplay pick, you can check the effects in the [wiki](https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/15_Bespectacled_Intellectuals#Summoning_Campaign){:target="_blank"}
