# Expeditions
- From the 2nd tab of the shop menu, you can send dogs on expeditions
- Some dogs will have preferred expeditions, where they will clear faster
- Expeditions costs an ascension material and rewards QP, EXP or other ascension materials. Dog Knight Points are also rewarded per expedition.
    - You get back the material used after the expedition (like playing fetch with a dog) 
- You can set the app to send a notification when the expeditions are done by tapping on the off/on icon at the middle of the screen.

1. Arjuna/Touta (1-July)
- Use touta's S3 as much as possible. His s1 (buster up) also has a heal so save it for later.
