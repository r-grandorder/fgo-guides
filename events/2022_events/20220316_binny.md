# Frequently Asked Questions
## Do I farm 90 or 90+?
- Both 90 and 90+ drop the same amount of lotto currency. 90+ has the benefit of also giving shop mats. Whether you farm 90 or 90+ is dependent on a few factors:
- Which one is easier to farm (whether that be team comp or plugsuit)
- Do I want the mat drops from 90 or 90+
- Personal restrictions
- Players will often farm 90+ until they shop clear and then choose between 90 and 90+. If you cannot farm one rotation's 90+ node, potentially wait for a different one.

## When do I MLB?
- See this chart (the CE is from a different event but it's the same timing).
