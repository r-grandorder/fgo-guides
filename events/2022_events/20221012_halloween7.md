# Points and Appointment System
- Doing Free Quests and Fundraising Quests gives you points depending on the bonus you have. So setup your servants before using AP on the Free Quests.
- You can setup the servants in the first tab of the event's shop.
- There are three different points: Military Service (Red), Government (Blue), Internal Affairs (Green)
- Each of the points has different goals and respective rewards. For the first day, Blue = QP, Red = Bullets, Green = EXP and Wine.
- Each "Inn" has a different target amount of points and the bonus depends on the servants slotted in that specific "Inn".
- Use the event CEs from the shop to further boost your points.
- The servant's level determines the amount of bonuses you get. You can also opt to change the "support" servants to your copy if you have a grailed version.
- Fundraising Quests (5AP quests) will likely have boosted points drops, make sure you have a decent amount of bonuses before doing them.

- You can auto assign servants to the slots by clicking on the blue button under the list of jobs on the left.
- Auto assignment will fill from top to bottom, so your level 120 servants will go to the top with Amakusa

# Fundraising Quests
- The fundraising quests requires a number of jobs (check the number in the screenshot below) done before you can do them.
- These are limited in number, so maximize your points bonuses before doing the quests.
