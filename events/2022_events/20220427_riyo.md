# Excavation
- Whenever you do Free Quests, you get `Excavation Tools`. 
- From the event shop, you can use the `Excavation Tools` to Excavate (duh).
- Excavation will reward you with `Bunnypay points` which is used to progress the story and get rewards from the Ladder.

## Resetting the board
- You have an option to reset the board once you've unlocked 10 tiles, but you'll lose any of the rewards that you didn't get.

## Optimizing Excavations Guide c/o supermarth64#8626
Similar to the digging Pokemon Diamond/Pearl Underground Digging game and the Imaginary Scramble sonar mechanic, the excavation mechanic provides you with both points and materials. This can be reset infinitely similar to lottos.

The mats that are dropped are tied to the tile pattern. It is recommended to only farm tiles for mats that you want. The corresponding list of mats and their tiles is in this image: 

![](https://i.imgur.com/aOyHrCH.png)

On each board, there are anywhere between 1-3 bonus mats that are acquired when you mine the 4 tiles that overlap it. You can thus optimize digging to find those 4 tile mats and then reset early once you've determined if you've found all of them (or only care about a specific one). Dupes of the 4 tile mats are possible.

This is an example image of a board that only has one 4 tile mat. You can see that every 4 tile region is uncovered partially already and thus can reset early if you do not care about the other tile types.
